**Development**: The test development on Intellij IDE with the BDD style framework
**Projected Skillset**: Java, JUnit, Rest assured, Maven

1. Test cases written in BDD ( I wish to showcase my skills in UI test development and followed BDD approach here )
2. Covered more than 10 test cases all for different type of input
